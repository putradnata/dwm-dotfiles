Yey another 'just work' setup.

## Setup in Actions 📸

I didn't do too much from default DWM configuration, since the base DWM kinda 'enough' for me.

## Motivation and Why DWM?

After my journey Distro-hopping and DEs/WMs-hopping, now finally I find my place. ✨**_DWM_**✨.

Have been tired using Desktop Enviroments because I just feel something not right there, and something just always fail there.

So decide to fall to the hole of Window Manager. I've tried many famous Window Managers, like **_HerbstluftWM_**, **_BSPW_**, **_XMonad_**, etc. But, I kinda overwhelmed with their config file. I even tried someones 'dotfiles' to tinkering around, but still didn't get what it does.

At first time I know DWM, i fell like 'meh, too technical for me who doesn't like code that much.'. But after give it try, patching, try and error so many times. Now, I feel this is so worth it!

DWM also very lightweight, even when idle and I have some autostarting program it's only take 700MB RAM. This is nice for someone who always think:

\*_PS: If you see code on screenshot, it's not mine. It's just a code I clone from GitHub, just for showcase purpose. LOL_

## Installation

Do you want this `𝓬𝓸𝓸𝓵` and yet `ｍｉｎｉｍａｌｉｓｔｉｃ` setup on your Linux machine??? Easy, just clone this repo.

Then build it with this command on each folder.

Example:

```bash
    cd  /home/<yourusernameofcourse>/suckless/dwm
    sudo make clean install
```

Do the same thing for the rest of folders, then you should be able to go.
